# Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks

## From Abstract
### 1.  This report deep CNN
 - unlike traditional methods(handle each component separately), jointly optimizes all layers
 - lightweight structure, 
 - achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage

This report explore different network structures and parameter settings to achieve tradeoffs between performance and speed. 
This report extend the network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality.

## From INTRODUCTION

1. image super-resolution (SR) : aims at recovering a high-resolution image from a single lowresolution image
  - prior soluation: example-based strategy
    - exploit internal similarities of the same image
    - learn mapping functions from external low- and high-resolution exemplar pairs
